Hexadom
-------

This script takes a plain text file containing characters from 0 to f and creates an html file to visualize in firefox 3D view.

Sample files in ./demos/

Run with:

    ./hexadom input.txt output.html [True|False]
        
The last parameter as True randomizes the created elements between `i`(black in 3D view), and `span`(green in 3D view).
